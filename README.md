<h1 align="center">PyBer Analysis</h1>

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to compare the fares of PyBer in three types of cities: Rural, Suburban and Urban. Fare data were analyzed based on number of rides and number of drivers.

## Results

There are clear differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Among all, urban cities have the highest number of rides, highest number of drivers, and lowest average fare per ride and per driver. It shows that people take shorter rides with higher frequency in urban areas. PyBer also enjoys the highest revenue from these cities. In contrast, rural cities have the lowest number of rides, lowest number of drivers, and highest fare per ride and per driver. It shows that people take longer rides with less frequency in rural areas.

## Summary
Based on the results, I'd like to provide three business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types:
1. There are more drivers than number of rides in Urban cities, indicating an oversupply of service. PyBer may consider reducing the number of drivers in urban cities to avoid canalisation.
2. 
3. It would be helpful for PyBer to add the distance of each ride into this analysis, which will help determine if the fare rate is comparable between different type of cities. Discriminative pricing is a lever that the company could use to enhance profitbility. For instance, people in urban areas would be less pricing sensitive as there are usually more business trips.

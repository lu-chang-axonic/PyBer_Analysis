## Overview
The purpose of this project is to summarize the student's math and reading performance by schools in the district. The performance was also measured by grade, by school spending, by school size, and by school type. Furthermore, the analysis has examined the impact of removing the 9th grade reading and math scores from the Thomas High School ("THS"), give suspected cheating activity.
